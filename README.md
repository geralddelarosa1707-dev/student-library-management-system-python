# Student Library Management System (Python)

A console-based Python application that allows managing books and student borrowing records.
This project was created as part of my practice in learning Python, focusing on dictionaries, functions, and file handling.

## Features
• Add, remove, and update books
• Borrow and return books
• Search student or book
• View all borrowed records
• Check available books
• JSON file persistence
• Input validation and basic error handling

## What I Learned From This Project
• Using dictionaries to store structured data
• Creating and calling functions
• Input validation
• Error handling using try and except
• Working with JSON files for data storage

## Technologies Used
• Python
• JSON for data storage

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Open terminal or command prompt
Run:
python student_library_management_system.py

## Notes
• The program automatically creates a library_data.json file to store data.
• Data will be saved even after closing the program.
